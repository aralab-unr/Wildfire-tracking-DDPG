# Multi-UAV Collaborative Deep Learning and Consensus to Maximize Coverage Over Continuous and Dynamic Wildfire Environment

This is the implementation of methods discussed in the paper, proposed in IROS 2023. To access the paper used this [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pgpPX0bzjf6ChFjhr3SZ44L6XKJNPrqr/view?usp=sharing). This project was built on Python 3.9.13 and PyTorch 1.13.0.

## Abstract
We all are aware of consequences of the wildfire, especially when controlling the spread is challenging. Firefighters try to understand the environment in planning strategies to get the wildfire under control. To analyze the environment, gathering information is crucial. People around the world came up with their way of approaches to achieve this task. Deploying UAVs are one of the best ways for tracking, covering, and gathering information about wildfire. A team of UAVs has additional advantages too. There were many approaches discussed regarding the use of multiple UAVs to track and cover the fire region. Very few were discussed about the communication between the UAVs with respect to their performance. In this paper, we discuss 4 different variations of communications within the team of UAVs and compare them based on a set of performance measures like not just the reward collection but also the coverage, the duration of tracking, and other environmental metrics.
